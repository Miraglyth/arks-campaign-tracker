# github-pages-test
Dummy repo to test out and sandbox github pages

## Style notes
- For announcements and campaigns: nameShort is optional and not needed at all if name is already short

### To-do
- Limit detail view to one expanded row at a time
- Top menu options: Instant update (enabled by default), hide done campaigns (disabled by default)
- Improve look of tabs and prevent from leaving top of screen when scrolling, maybe improve navbar in the process
- Include boosts in various views
- A way of saying start/end of maintenance - I'm thinking a dot-line beneath the time with a tooltip like "Est. Maintenance"
- Potential consolidation of duplicate rewards in the unexpanded row (would need quantities for each, could improve aesthetic if I do)
- External: Some form of campaign input mechanism that can spit out the JSON file
- Continued aesthetic improvement

### Probably not
- Potential condensation of campaigns with singular activities and rewards to not use arrays and determine using .typeof (Though this would divide the format...)
