# github-pages-test
Dummy repo to test out and sandbox github pages

## Style notes
- For campaigns: nameShort is optional and not needed at all if name is already short

### To-do
- Limit detail view to one expanded row at a time
- Add Bootstrap tabs for Ended, Active and Upcoming
- Prevent navbar and tabs from leaving top of screen when scrolling
- Include boosts in various views
- A way of saying start/end of maintenance instead of guessing time? (But would need to equate it to time anyway for sorting...)
- Potential condensation of campaigns with singular activities and rewards to not use arrays and determine using .typeof (Though this would divide the format...)
- Potential consolidation of duplicate rewards in the unexpanded row (would need quantities for each)
- Rework bullets in multiple rewards either by removing them from li or replacing ul with a line break somehow
- External: Some form of campaign input mechanism that can spit out the JSON file
- Continued aesthetic improvement
