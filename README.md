# Style notes
- For announcements and campaigns: nameShort is optional and should be omitted if name is already short
- For all times: startsNote, endsNote and distributionNote are optional and should only be used to describe possible deviation such as maintenances

# Potential improvements
- Remove link when an announcement has no url attribute
- Potentially-automated shrinking of long reward names in summary row
- Include boosts in various views
- Consider reworking dateParse due to overzealous interpretation by Chrome (e.g. "Early August 2021" parsing the 2021 and consequently the August too)
- Continued aesthetic improvement
- External: Some form of campaign input mechanism that can spit out the JSON file
