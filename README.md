# github-pages-test
Dummy repo to test out and sandbox github pages

## Style notes
- For announcements and campaigns: nameShort is optional and should be omitted if name is already short
- For all times: startsNote, endsNote and distributionNote are optional and should only be used to describe possible deviation such as maintenances

### To-do before beta
- Add settings (and script!) to About page
- Fix detail view expanding/collapsing when checking done with instant update off - Remove collapse action on columns with links and checkboxes

### To-do nice to have
- Potential consolidation of duplicate rewards in the unexpanded row (would need quantities for each, could improve aesthetic if I do)
- Include boosts in various views
- Continued aesthetic improvement

### To-do later
- External: Some form of campaign input mechanism that can spit out the JSON file

### Probably not
- Potential condensation of campaigns with singular activities and rewards to not use arrays and determine using .typeof (Though this would divide the format...)
