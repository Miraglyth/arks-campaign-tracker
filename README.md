# github-pages-test
Dummy repo to test out and sandbox github pages

#### To-do
- Finish adding accordion rows
- Add Bootstrap tabs for Ended, Active and Upcoming
- Prevent navbar and tabs from leaving top of screen when scrolling
- Fix sorting in Firefox to not reverse
- Include boosts in various views
- Consider short campaign names
- Potential condensation of campaigns with singular activities and rewards to not use arrays and determine using .typeof (though this would divide the format)
- Potential consolidation of duplicate rewards in the unexpanded row (would need quantities for each)
- Fix left and right padding that gets added to li bullets in Chrome (-1px and 16px respectively) or just ditch bullets
- Continued aesthetic improvement

#### Style notes
- If campaignName is short, campaignNameShort isn't needed
