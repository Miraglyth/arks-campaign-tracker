# github-pages-test
Dummy repo to test out and sandbox github pages

## Style notes
- For announcements and campaigns: nameShort is optional and should be omitted if name is already short
- For all times: startsNote, endsNote and distributionNote are optional and should only be used to describe possible deviation such as maintenances

### Potential improvements
- Potential consolidation of duplicate rewards in the unexpanded row (would need quantities for each, could improve aesthetic if I do)
- Include boosts in various views
- Continued aesthetic improvement
- External: Some form of campaign input mechanism that can spit out the JSON file
